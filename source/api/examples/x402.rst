Fast x402 Payments with 1Shot API
=================================

x402 is a payment standard proposed by Coinbase that enables API services to charge for access by piggybacking on top 
of the existing HTTP 402 status code. Specifically, x402 enables API customers, particularly AI agents, to pay for and 
gain access to premium API resources by cryptographically signing (see `EIP-712 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712>`_) 
time-bound value transfers that are executed onchain by a fascilitator (e.g. 1Shot API).

This demo focuses on `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_ as the web server framework and leverages 
`Pydantic <https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/>`_ for data validation of the x402 payload specifications.

Specifically, we show how FastAPI route dependencies can be used to implement x402 payments while being minimally invasive 
to your existing codebase.
