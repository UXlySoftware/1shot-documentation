Once you have created an organization, you can add team members to it. Team members can be added by going to the "Team" tab on the organization details page and clicking on the "Update" 
button. 

You will need to enter the email address of the team member you want to add and select their role. They will receive an email notification that they have been given access to your organization.
You team members will be able to access your organization's projects and resources. You can also assign roles to team members, which will determine what actions they are allowed to 
perform within your organization.
