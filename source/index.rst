Welcome to 1Shot!
=================================

The 1Shot API is the first fully managed transaction service for the Etherum mainnet and L2 ecosystem. It provides a simple REST interface
to trigger state-changing transactions on your target network with a single API call. This greatly simplifies added digital assets or on-chain 
logic to any application, regardless of the target network, or the language your application is developed in. 

1Shot provides help client sdks for popular languages like Python, Typescript, C#, and PHP, so you can get one-shot your next app in no time,
leaving the complexities of transaction submission and monitoring to us.

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.
