Transaction Configuration
==========================

Before you can start using the 1Shot transaction API, you'll need to configure one or more transactions linked to an `escrow wallet <escrow-wallets.html>`_ with sufficient gas funds.

Webhooks are an optional configuration for you transaction endpoint but are highly recommended as they provide immediate feedback to your application once your transaction
has been confirmed on the blochchain network.
