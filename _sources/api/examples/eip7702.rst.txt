EIP-7702 Transaction Relayer: OKX Core Wallet
=============================================

On May 7, 2025, the Ethereum network completed the Pectra update, bringing with it a substantial enhancement for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).
Thanks to `EIP-7702 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702>`_ EOAs now possess polymorphic capabilities that allow them to function as if they were native smart contracts. This shift opens up an exciting new design space for EVM application developers.


This representative example uses a fork of the `OKX Core Wallet <https://github.com/okx/wallet-core>`_ to demonstrate how EIP-7702 transactions can be executed in 1Shot API simply by passing an `authorizationList <https://github.com/UXlySoftware/okx-wallet-core-with-1shot/blob/main/scripts/1shot_demo/1-setCodeAndInitialize.ts#L130>`_ when calling ``execute``. This example illustrates how developers can leverage the new features of EOAs to enhance user experience and streamline interactions with smart contracts.
